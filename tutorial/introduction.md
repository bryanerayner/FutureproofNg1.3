# Future-proof Angular Development with Typescript


Angular has been getting a lot of press recently. What began as a pioneering framework, is now deemed by
many to be *too* pioneering. At Ng-conf Europe, the Angular JS team surprised many people with the sheer
volume of changes in Angular 2.0. At first, Angular 2.0 seems like an entirely different beast; it has a
new dependency injection system, new syntax for directives, and a new module system. In addition to all
these changes, was the scariest part of Ng-Conf Europe - AtScript. People complained, the Ember core team
promised a safer framework, and many began to raise their concerns about Angular JS.

Many developers are turning their backs on Angular JS - But not you. You’re a savvy developer who wants to
learn new things! You’re not afraid of change - You embrace it, and want to face it head on. The question is,
how can you enter Angular JS development in a way that your projects are ready for the transition?


## Outline

In this tutorial, we propose the use of Typescript to ease transition from the current Angular syntax, to
the final syntax of Angular 2.0.

This tutorial will be broken into three parts. First, we'll start with a Javascript Angular 1.3 app.
We'll then refactor the application to Typescript, demonstrating how to set up a build process along the way.
Finally, we'll explore the syntax of Angular 2.0 and AtScript, and demonstrate how the TypeScript code easily
transitions to Angular 2.0.


## Typescript

One of Angular 2.0's primary features is the introduction of class annotation and static type checking. As you
may have noticed, AtScript has been designed as a superset of the TypeSript syntax for checking types. While
AtScript won't be available to use in development until Angular 2.0 is released, TypeScript is a mature platform
available for use today.
